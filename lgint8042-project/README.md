# CSC 515 Project - Landan Ginther 

## Steps to run: 
First begin by ensuring you have all needed components installed by running: 
`npm install`

Secondly, it is important to make sure you have an API key stored for the YouTube API. Simply create a `.env` file within the main project directy (`lgint8042-project`) and include the line `REACT_APP_API_KEY={YOUR_API_KEY}` and you should be set to continue to the next step. 

Once everything installs, simply run `npm start` to run a development build of the application. To run a production version of the app, run `npm run build` before running `npm start`.
